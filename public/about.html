    <p>A friend of mine writes short stories. One sunny day, I asked if he wanted a website to showcase his works and he agreed. I decided to use GitHub Pages to host his site. That way he wouldn't have to buy a domain and a server.</p>
<p>While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this <em>simple, blog-aware, static site generator</em> called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which works really well with GitHub Pages. I figured it would do just fine for my friend and I set about searching for a pretty theme. I wanted a theme with a <em>book-ish</em> vibe. Unfortunately, most of the themes were too modern. Eventually, I caved and begun working on my own theme. With the help of <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">Poole</a>, the Jekyll Butler, I was able to build <strong>Tale</strong>.</p>
